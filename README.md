## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/amundv/thesis-presentation/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/amundv/thesis-presentation/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

<p>These samples are reconstructions from a VQ-VAE that compresses the audio input over 64x times into discrete latent codes (see figure below). Both the VQ-VAE and latent space are trained end-to-end without relying on phonemes or information other than the waveform itself. Although the reconstructed waveforms are very different in shape from the originals, they sound very similar.</p>
